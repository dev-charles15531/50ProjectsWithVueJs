# iPhone Lockscreen + mp3 Player

<table>

  An iPhone lockscreen UI with mp3 player and more.<br><br>
 
  This is the 15th project under my [50 projects with vue](https://github.com/dev-charles15531/50ProjectsWithVueJs) learning journey and i'm happy exploring the magic and all sweet things one can do on the web with [vue 3](http://vuejs.org).
  Unfortunately, there's a functionality which i am unable to implement, and i believe there's someone out there who can do this and all i am asking for is your contribution (i'll highlight this feature below).

    Your contributions and critiques are highly welcome here as that would be a means for me to get better.
